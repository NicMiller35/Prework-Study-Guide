## Description
This project is an interactive study guide to allow the user to practice coding language and webtools for the first day of class. The building of this project was to ensure a base knowledge of different coding languages to use for the bootcamp. It solves multiple problems including how to use HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript. Through making this project I learned the basiccs of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
